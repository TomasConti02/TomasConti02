Hi everyone, I'm Tomas Conti.
On this GitHub, I upload my student projects that I develop during my university courses.
I'm a master's student in Computer Engineering at the University of Bologna.
I have a strong interest in cloud computing, and I’m currently learning SIMD.
I'm also looking for an exciting internship opportunity as part of my master’s degree.

Feel free to contact me at:
